    <h3>Easy And Simple Chicken Parmigiana Recipe.</h3>
    <p>Is there anything better than crispy, golden crumb-coated chicken topped with a rich tomato sauce and gooey melted cheese?</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>4 Chicken Breasts, excess fat trimmed</li>
        <li>140g (2 cups) panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly whisked</li>
        <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>125ml (1/2 cup) light extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (about 350g) eggplant, cut into 1cm-thick slices</li>
        <li>8 large fresh basil leaves, torn</li>
        <li>180g ctn bocconcini, drained, thickly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 brown onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>700g bottle tomato passata</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place each chicken fillet between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Use a mallet or rolling pin to gently pound the thickest part of the chicken until the fillets are an even thickness. Place breadcrumbs in a dish.</li>
        <li>Place egg in a bowl. Place flour on a plate. Season. Coat fillets in flour. Shake off excess. Coat in egg. Coat in breadcrumbs, pressing firmly to stick. Transfer to a tray. Cover. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes to set.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add a third of the eggplant. Cook for 2-3 minutes each side until golden. Drain on paper towel. Repeat in 2 batches, adding a little extra oil as needed.</li>
        <li>For the sauce, heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add onion. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until soft. Stir in garlic for 1-2 minutes or until aromatic. Add passata. Cook, stirring, for 15 minutes or until thickened.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180C/160C fan forced. Heat remaining oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook schnitzels, in 2 batches, for 2 minutes each side or until golden. Drain on paper towel.</li>
        <li>Place half the sauce in a roasting pan. Top with eggplant and chicken. Drizzle with remaining sauce. Sprinkle with basil and top with bocconcini. Bake for 15 minutes or until melted and golden.</li>
