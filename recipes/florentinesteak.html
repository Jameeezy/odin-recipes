    <h3>Grandma's favorite Bistecca alla Fiorentina.</h3>
    <p>Nearly every Tuscan home cook is an expert at bistecca fiorentina, a traditional Florentine steak recipe that calls for only five ingredients. The steak is typically from Chianina cattle — an ancient Tuscan breed known for its prized and tasty meat — seasoned with local spices and grilled over red-hot coals. It's traditionally served “rare,” but we won't judge if you ask for medium.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 T-bone or porterhouse steak, at least 3 inches thick & 3-3½ pounds</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh sage</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt & freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill pan on medium-high heat. Pat the steak dry, and season both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Tie the rosemary and sage bunches together with butcher's twine to form an herb brush. Use the herbs to brush the steak with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Place the steak on the grill pan, and char it well: cook about 12 minutes on the first side, flip, and cook about 9 minutes on the second side. Like we said earlier, this steak is traditionally served rare.</li>
        <li>When the steak is done, remove it from the grill pan and allow it to stand for 5 minutes so that the juices are retained when the meat is cut. Carve off the fillet and strip steaks, and slice before serving. Serve hot, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
